Handle Delivery was a startup based out of the University of Southern California that provided snack delivery services to students on college campuses across the country. I worked as a software engineer on the team, and I was responsible for developing the company's back-end infrastructure on Google Cloud and administrative/operations tools.

I developed a dashboard that allows the company and campus managers to view and manage the company's operations, including real-time analytics, order management, user management, and team management.

Additionally, I rebuilt the customer application, not including the
design, from the ground up to provide a more performant and responsive
experience, increasing customer retention by 20%.
