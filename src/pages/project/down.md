#### Lead Software Engineer
Down was a social media startup that aims to connect users with events going on in their area. I was responsible for the development of the back-end and cloud infrastructure. As a lead, I was also responsible for the technical direction of the back-end of the project, and I managed a team of engineers, performing code reviews, overseeing projects, and providing technical guidance. We designed scalable back-end services, including cloud functions, user authentication, and databases using Google Cloud to be implemented in the mobile application.

#### Software Engineering Intern
I started out on the team as a front-end software engineering intern in June 2021 for the alpha development phase, and I was promoted to lead software engineer in December 2022 for the beta development phase.
