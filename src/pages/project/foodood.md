FooDood is a mobile application that combines the concept of Tinder-swiping with selecting something to eat. Science says that it is easier to make a decision when presented with simple options such as "yes" or "no" rather than a large list of options. FooDood will present users with a list of food options in their area and they will be able to swipe left or right on the options to decide what to eat.

I worked on this project with a team of 3 other students. I developed the back end of the application primarily, including the recommendation algorithm, data fetching, and cloud resources. On the front end, I worked on performance optimizations and efficient data fetching.
