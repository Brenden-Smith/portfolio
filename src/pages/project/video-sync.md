Video Sync is a personal project that I created so that I could watch online videos simultaneously with my friends. I was inspired to create this project because I wasn't happy with the existing solutions. I wanted to create a solution that was easy to use, had a clean interface, and was free. I created the front-end using React/Next.js and the back end using Firebase and Google Cloud.
