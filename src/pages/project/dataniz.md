Dataniz is a website that allows users to generate IoT data.

I developed the middle end of the application, primarily working with the back end team to integrate an existing REST API into the front end with performance, efficiency, security, and cost in mind. I also developed the authentication flow on the front end, and worked with the design and front end teams to create a clean and intuitive user interface that complements the back end.
