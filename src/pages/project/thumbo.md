Thumbo is a startup that aims to engage fans at sporting events by providing mid-game activities for prizes. I worked with another engineer to design the alpha version of the application. I was responsible for the development of the back-end and cloud infrastructure for the alpha development phase. I designed all of the logic for the games, implemented cloud features from AWS and Google Cloud, managed the database, created the administrative and operations dashboards, and developed microservices to support the application.
